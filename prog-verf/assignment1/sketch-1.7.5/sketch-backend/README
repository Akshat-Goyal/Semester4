=== Building ===

If you are using windows, start by running
    >>> bash convertScripts.sh

If you are using OpenSuSE 11.3, to work around gcc 4.5 incompatibilities, install gcc43 and gcc43-cpp, and run (prior to configuring)
    >>> export CC=gcc-4.3
    >>> export CXX=g++-4.3

Then, configure and make SKETCH
    >>> ./autogen.sh
    >>> ./configure
    >>> make

=== Distributing ===

The frontend project, sketch-frontend, now handles building of all binary jar's (jar's which will extract the CEGIS backend automatically).
