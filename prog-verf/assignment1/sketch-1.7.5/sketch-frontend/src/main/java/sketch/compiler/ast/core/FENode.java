     * Create a new node with the specified context. Note on why it's deprecated: When the
     * parser creates nodes from scratch, it uses the FENode(FEContext) constructor to
     * create a brand new node with the context information about where in the input file
     * it came from. However, after this stage, any new FENode that is created is created
     * from another existing FENode. Keeping track of where nodes came from is important,
     * given how many transformations the AST goes through before we do the actual
     * analysis on it. For this reason, you shouldn't use the FENode(FEContext)
     * constructor when creating a node in a transformation; instead you should use the
     * FENode(FENode) constructor and pass as argument the node that this node was derived
     * from. So in other words, the FENode(FEContext) constructor is not really
     * deprecated; you need to use it when constructing nodes in the parser, but it
     * shouldn't be used anywhere else, so the deprecated status is a good way to
     * discourage its use. The same thing goes for all the constructors of the actual AST
     * nodes; all of them have a version that takes an FEContext and a version that takes
     * an FENode.
