Instructions.

First, you need to have:

* cygwin  (a minimal instalation will do)

* a java runtime environment.

Then, you can install following these steps:

* Put the contents of this folder in a directory.

* Create an environment variable SKETCH_HOME and make it equal to this directory.
(You can set environment variables by right-clicking on My Computer in the start
menu, and clicking on Properties. Then click on the Advanced tab, and there is
a button with the caption "Environment Variables").

* Add this directory to your PATH environment variable.

And that's it. Now you can call the synthesizer from the command line by just calling 

$ sketch

You can find some examples in the benchmarks directory in this distribution.
